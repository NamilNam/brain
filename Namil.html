	I played my frist computer game when I was like 4th or 5th grade. It was overwatch. I really enjoyed playing overwatch by myself, but I enjoyed
	even more when I played with my freinds. My best tier was gold, when it was a popular game. But I stopped playing when people stopped playing 
	overwatch including my freinds. Sometimes I want to go back to the time when overwatch was so fun and exciting. When I played overwatch that time I
	felt nervous, excting, and just feelings like I can't explain because I was so excited. However, I don't really play overwatch anymore but now I play
	the game called "League of Legends".

	Now I'm plyaing game called "League of Legends". I play other videogames like Rainbow six, The Isle, etc but I mainly play League of Legends now.
	The three biggest reasons are the characters and the setting made me really intrested. Second most of the friends, which means people around me
	plays. Third Riot is a smart company, they made the game complex which lead to fun. They have a system called rank system and most of the multiplayer
	games has this. You can compet with others through this system or compet with others with your rank. Riot made the rank system like if you win 4 times
	at your last point you can go up but if you don't you will go 10 points down wich made gamers eager.

	My partner, Jocelyn, her hobby is photography. She likes to take a picture of anything she likes. Most of the time she takes a picture of her or other's
	drawing. I guess she also likes to draw. However she likes to take a picture of drawings, because she wants to save her drawing if it's good or just
	record so that she can see in the future again.
